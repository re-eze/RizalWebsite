                        <h4>Summary</h4>
                        <p>Jose Protacio Rizal Mercado y Alonso Realonda was born on June 19, 1861 and 7th of the eleven children of Don Francisco Mercado and Dona Teodora Alonso. Rizal’s paternal great-great grandfather, Chinese
                            merchant, Domingo Lam-co, adopted the name “Mercado”, which means “market”. Jose’s father became primarily a farmer, he then adopted the surname <i>“Rizal”</i> (Ricial meaning <i>“the green of young growth”</i> or <i>“green fields”</i>). Rizal was born in Calamba, Laguna. The first massive stone house in Calamba was the birthplace of our national hero.</p>
                        
                            <p>-Rizal’s <b>first memory</b> was his happy days in their family garden when he was three years old. He was weak, sickly, and undersized, he was then given the fondest care by his parents, so his father built a nipa cottage for Pepe to play in daytime. </p>
                            <p>-At the age of <b>five</b>, he learned to read the Spanish family Bible. </p>
                            <p>-As a child, he loved to go to the chapel, pray, participate in novenas, and join religious processions. </p>
                            <p>-Also at the age of <b>five</b>, Rizal began to make pencil sketches and mold in clay and wax objects. </p>
                            <p>-At age <b>six</b>, his sisters laughed at him for spending much time making clay and wax images to which he prophetically responded, <i>“Alright laugh at me now! Someday when I die, people will make monuments and images of me’</i>.</p>
                            <p>-When Jose was <b>seven</b>, he experienced riding a casco with his father on their way to a pilgrimage in Antipolo. </p>
                            <p>-Jose received a pony named <i>“Alipato”</i> from his father. He loved to ride the pony or take a long walk with his black dog named <i>“Usman".</i> </p>
                            <p>-Before he was <b>eight</b>, he had written a drama which was performed at a local festival; the manuscript of the drama was purchased for two pesos by a gobernadorcillo from Paete.</p>
                            <p>-Contrary to common knowledge, Rizal did not write the Filipino poem <i>“Sa Aking mga Kababata/Kabata”</i> </p>
                            <p>-The young Rizal was also interested in magic. He learned different tricks – making a coin disappear & making a handkerchief vanish in thin air. </p>

                      <h4>Rizal on Abroad</h4>
                      <p>Jose Rizal, born on June 19, 1861, in Calamba, Laguna, Philippines, hailed from a prosperous family with educated parents, Francisco Mercado and Teodora Alonzo Realonda. His educational journey included studies at Ateneo Municipal de Manila and the University of Santo Tomas in Manila before pursuing medicine, literature, and political science in Spain. Rizal became a prolific writer, penning influential works such as "Noli Me Tangere" and "El Filibusterismo," which exposed the injustices of Spanish colonial rule and fueled nationalist sentiments.</p>

<p>A proponent of peaceful reform, Rizal advocated for change through education and enlightenment rather than armed revolution. Despite facing persecution, he continued his intellectual pursuits during periods of exile, including in Dapitan in Mindanao. Rizal's association with the Propaganda Movement, a group of Filipino intellectuals seeking political reforms, marked a significant chapter in his activism.
<br><br>
<p><b style="font-size: 18px;">Spain:</b> Rizal's first significant journey abroad was to Spain, where he pursued higher education. He attended the Universidad Central de Madrid, studying medicine, literature, and political science. During his stay in Spain, he actively participated in the Propaganda Movement, advocating for reforms in the Philippines.</p>

<p><b style="font-size: 18px;">Germany:</b> Rizal continued his studies in Heidelberg, Germany, where he conducted research and completed his second novel, "El Filibusterismo." His exposure to European thought and culture influenced his perspective on governance and social issues.</p>

<p><b style="font-size: 18px;">France:</b> Rizal spent some time in France, particularly in Paris, where he continued to refine his ideas and engage with other intellectuals. He frequented libraries and museums, absorbing knowledge and inspiration for his literary and political works.</p>

<p><b style="font-size: 18px;">Belgium:</b> Rizal visited Brussels, Belgium, where he continued his writing and political activities. It was during this time that he contributed articles to Filipino publications and continued his efforts to expose the injustices of Spanish rule in the Philippines.</p>

<p><b style="font-size: 18px;">Austria:</b> Rizal briefly visited Austria, where he continued his studies and observations of European society. He maintained correspondence with fellow Filipino expatriates and continued his advocacy for reforms.</p>

<p><b style="font-size: 18px;">Switzerland:</b> Rizal spent some time in Switzerland, notably in Wilhelmsfeld, where he worked on his annotations to Antonio Morga's "Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas." This work aimed to provide historical context and counter Spanish colonial propaganda about the Philippines.</p>

<p><b style="font-size: 18px;">United States:</b> Rizal traveled to the United States, particularly to San Francisco and other cities on the west coast. He observed American society and governance, comparing it to the situation in the Philippines. His experiences in the U.S. contributed to his understanding of governance and nationalism.</p>

<p><b style="font-size: 18px;">Japan:</b> Rizal visited Japan during his return journey to the Philippines. He admired the discipline and progress of the Japanese society, finding inspiration for potential reforms in his homeland.</p></div>
